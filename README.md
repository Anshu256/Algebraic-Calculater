<h1>Algebraic Calculater</h1></br>
A simple project to calculate the product of two or more algebraic factors in python. This will cut down time for pesky algebraic simplification.</br>
Features currently in progress:-
<ol>
  <li>
    support for exponents in the factors
  </li>
</ol>
Features planned:-
<ol>
  <li>
    support for various greek symbols
  </li> 
  <li>
    support for various identities for simplification
  </li>
  <li>
    support for trignometry and calculas and their identities
  </li>
  <li>
    maybe AI for identifying the identities to use and make its own identities?
  </li>
</ol>
